This is a ruby on rails application that queries twitter data from the twitter api. It searches for 500 recent tweets with #analytics and inserts the tweets into a database. The home page is a form to create a new collection of tweets. The page is then redirected to the index of collections where you can edit, update, destroy or view each collection of tweets. Once a user is shown an individual twitter collection they have the choice to view, edit or delete indvidual tweets.
